> Interacting with the ClickUp v2 API from R

[ClickUp](https://clickup.com/?noRedirect=true) is a cloud-based collaboration and project management tool. 
Features include tasks, docs, chat, goals, and [more](https://clickup.com/features).

The {clickrup} R package wraps the ClickUp [API v2](https://clickup.com/api). 
See the [roadmap](https://github.com/psolymos/clickrup/issues/1) for what is currently included in the package.

## Setup

Install the {clickrup} package:

```{r eval=FALSE}
remotes::install_github("psolymos/clickrup")
```

Follow this [tutorial](https://docs.clickup.com/en/articles/1367130-getting-started-with-the-clickup-api):

- Sign up for ClickUp (you can use this referral [link](https://clickup.com?fp_ref=peter51) to do so, it's free)
- Navigate to your personal *Settings*
- Click *Apps* in the left sidebar
- Click *Generate* to create your API token
- Click *Copy* to copy the key to your clipboard

Add your ClickUp token as an environment variable. There are 
[various ways](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12291418/how-can-i-make-r-read-my-environmental-variables) of doing that. 
Use `Sys.setenv(CU_PAT="your_token")` 
or add a line with `CU_PAT="your_token"` to the `.Renviron` file.
adding `"your_token"` from the previous step.

## API endpoints

The first step you want to do is to get the IDs for your workspaces (teams is the legacy term for this in the API):

If your setup was successful, `cu_get_teams()` should return a list with the workspace IDs and names.

The easiest way to get going with the various endpoints is to browse the [API v2 documentation](https://clickup.com/api).
Once you found what you are after, just look at the API heading. There is **Get Teams**, the R function
is prepended with `cu_` (to facilitate RStudio suggestions), then comes the heading in lower case and spaces replaced by underscores.
For example **Get Filtered Team Tasks** will be `cu_get_filtered_team_tasks()`.

Function arguments are the *Parameters* listed on the API page, `...` passes optional parameters, query parameters, 
or elements for the body.

## Examples

Load the package and set the access token.
`cu_get_pat()` returns the token invisibly, so it doesn't
end up in logs.

```{r}
library(clickrup)

#cu_set_pat("pk_4753994_EXP7MPOJ7XQM5UJDV2M45MPF0YHH5YHO")
cu_get_pat() # returns PAT invisibly
```

### ClikUp hierarchy

The [ClickUp hierarchy](https://docs.clickup.com/en/articles/1045623-how-does-the-hierarchy-structure-work-in-clickup) includes the following levels:

- Workspaces (teams is the legacy term for this in the API)
- Spaces
- Folders
- Lists
- Tasks
- Subtasks
- Checklists

We can list Workspaces that we have access to as

```{r}
Teams <- cu_get_teams()
str(Teams, 3)
```

Spaces within a specific Workspace defined by its `team_id`

```{r}
team_id <- Teams$teams[[2]]$id
Spaces <- cu_get_spaces(team_id)
str(Spaces, 3)
```

Folders within a specific Space defined by its `space_id`

```{r}
space_id <- Spaces$spaces[[2]]$id
Folders <- cu_get_folders(space_id)
str(Folders, 3)
```

Lists within a specific Folder defined by its `folder_id`
(or Folderless Lists based on `space_id`)

```{r}
folder_id <- Folders$folders[[1]]$id
Lists <- cu_get_lists(folder_id)
str(Lists, 3)

cu_get_lists_folderless(space_id)
```

### Tasks

We can list Tasks within a specific List defined by its `list_id`

```{r}
list_id <- Lists$lists[[1]]$id
Tasks <- cu_get_tasks(list_id)
str(Tasks, 2)
```

Notice that we have `r length(Tasks$tasks)` tasks in the list.
We can include Subtasks too

```{r}
subTasks <- cu_get_tasks(list_id, subtasks=TRUE)
length(subTasks$tasks)
```

Getting all the tasks (possibly filtered) in a Workspace
is done via the `cu_get_filtered_team_tasks` function.
This function returns tasks in batches of 100.
If you don't want to deal with paging, use the
wrapper function `cu_get_tasks_all`

```{r}
allSubTasks <- cu_get_tasks_all(team_id, subtasks=TRUE)
length(allSubTasks$tasks)
```

Let's inspect the first few elements of a Tasl object

```{r}
str(Tasks$tasks[[1]][1:10])
```

Dates are given as Unix time (in milliseconds),
`cu_date` and `cu_time` is there to convert back and forth

```{r}
Tasks$tasks[[1]]$date_created
cu_date(Tasks$tasks[[1]]$date_created)
cu_time(cu_date(Tasks$tasks[[1]]$date_created))
```

A single task can be accessed through the task ID
(note: copying the task ID from the ClickUp gui will prepend
the task ID by a hash, `"#8ckjp5"`, but the API expects
ID without the hash `"8ckjp5"`).

The `$parent` property is `NULL` for Tasks, and 
it contains the parent Task ID for Subtasks

```{r}
x1 <- cu_get_task("8ckjp5") # task
x1$parent

x2 <- cu_get_task("8ckjru") # subtask
x2$parent
```

Dependencies are stored in the `$dependencies` property

```{r}
x1$dependencies
```

### Helper functions

`cu_options` stores the API settings

```{r}
str(cu_options())
```

`cu_response` allows inspecting the response object

```{r}
cu_response(Teams)
```

Check rate limits and remaining requests

```{r}
cu_ratelimit(subTasks)
```
